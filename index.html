Amidst the rising concerns over microplastics and their effects on health, it is important for those interested to be able to access information regarding the issue with ease and with relevant context, and so this paper will describe the way that microplastics make their way into UK drinking water, the effect this has on human life, and then use that information to outline the current and future steps needed to reduce the health risk these microplastics pose. While there is little difference between the concentration of microplastics of bottled and tap water, the size distribution of these particles is skewed towards smaller particles, which have increased mobility within the body and stronger toxic effects. While steps are being taken to allow for better comparisons to be made between studies, more work is needed in order to limit future contamination of drinking water.
