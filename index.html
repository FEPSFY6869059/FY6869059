Amidst the rising concerns over microplastics and their effects on health, it is important for those interested to be able to access information regarding the issue with ease and with relevant context, and so this paper will describe the way that microplastics make their way into UK drinking water, the effect this has on human life, and then use that information to outline the current and future steps needed to reduce the health risk these microplastics pose. While there is little difference between the concentration of microplastics of bottled and tap water, the size distribution of these particles is skewed towards smaller particles, which have increased mobility within the body and stronger toxic effects. While steps are being taken to allow for better comparisons to be made between studies, more work is needed in order to limit future contamination of drinking water.

The growing reliance on plastic materials has led to an abundance of plastic waste across the global environment, being found in all bodies of water to some extent, including drinking water. Perhaps because of this, microplastics have been a growing concern with regards to its effects on human health, and methods of monitoring its presence in drinking water have been added to the European Drinking Water Directive in order to understand the magnitude of its effects [cite here]. Microplastics (MPs) are considered to be small plastic particles with a size of <5 mm, and can be either primary (Intentionally created microplastics) or secondary (microplastics that occur from the degradation of a larger plastic material). As research continues on the quantities and qualities of microplastics in various forms of drinking water, a rising need for discussion about the dangers of microplastics in the context of its observed qualities has developed. The aim of this paper is to facilitate that discussion by presenting the current information on the effects of microplastics on human health in the context of what is known about microplastic content in the drinking water of the UK.

How concerning is the MP content of UK drinking water? A study looking into the contents of MPs in UK tap and bottled water estimated that the amount of MPs ingested via drinking water per Kg of body mass per day to be around (4 MP/kg BW/day) for an infant and (1 MP/kg BW/day) for an adult. That same study also looked into the morphology of these MPs, finding that the most common shapes for these MPs to take were fragment and fibrous, as well as the fact that bottled water had a smaller average size of MPs. It was also discovered that the polymer type of MPs found in bottled water was strongly correlated to the polymer type of the bottle cap - “Interestingly, a strong correlation was observed (r = 0.68, P = 0.049) between the plastic cap material (PE) and the predominant polymer type of microplastics in the bottled water in the present study.’’ Due to this finding being consistent with other studies looking into similar subject matter, it seems to indicate that the use of plastic caps plays a significant role in the release of microplastics into drinking water. The similarity between the concentration of microplastics between bottled and tap water indicates multiple sources of contamination, with primary suspects being pollutants in the water source and leaching from water pipes.

Research into the properties of MPs and how they affect the body has revealed that smaller MPs are able to perforate throughout muscle and other tissue, and into important organs such as the kidney, liver, brain, and heart. This buildup can lead to swelling and blockages, causing long term health effects. The MPs contain many additives, such as plasticizers, fire retardants, and pigments. These additives are considered to be responsible for many of the adverse effects that MPs have on living organisms; Including oxidative stress, cytotoxic effects, and cancer, as well as producing obesogenic effects. Due to the large surface area and electrostatic properties of MPs, other pollutants are able to adhere to them and gain access to organs and body parts that would otherwise be protected against them, further increasing the risk associated with the intake of microplastics into the body. The fact that children seem to consume more microplastics when compared to their body weight is concerning, as their undeveloped immune system makes them more vulnerable to the toxic effects of microplastics and their additives. The toxic effects of MPs may also be transgenerational, though further research is needed to fully understand the extent and severity of these effects.

  <p class="ex1">
While there is no recommended level of intake, due to the concerning effects of MPs and their global prevalence, steps have been taken to reduce the amount of MPs consumed by people on a daily basis. The EU has enacted a directive to standardise the methods of detecting MPs in drinking water, allowing for easier comparisons between studies to be made. Concerns have been brought up over the difficulty in identifying particularly small microplastics (<10μm), leading to possible underestimation of actual microplastic concentration. This is particularly worrying due to the fact that microplastics smaller than 10μm are able to bypass the cell wall, and disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential. Despite direct action to limit the concentration of MPs in drinking water, a number of possible changes have been put forth; based on the fact that plastic caps seem to play a significant role in the addition of MPs in bottled water, it is believed that by either designing bottle caps that are put under less stress during use, or by phasing out plastic caps entirely, that the concentration of MPs in bottled water may be reduced. Microplastic content of tap water is largely reduced during the water treatment process, up to 90% in some cases, but may be further reduced by looking into the quality of water pipes, the taps, and the treatment process.
