Amidst the rising concerns over microplastics and their effects on health, it is important for those interested to be able to access information regarding the issue with ease and with relevant context, and so this paper will describe the way that microplastics make their way into UK drinking water, the effect this has on human life, and then use that information to outline the current and future steps needed to reduce the health risk these microplastics pose. While there is little difference between the concentration of microplastics of bottled and tap water, the size distribution of these particles is skewed towards smaller particles, which have increased mobility within the body and stronger toxic effects. While steps are being taken to allow for better comparisons to be made between studies, more work is needed in order to limit future contamination of drinking water.

The growing reliance on plastic materials has led to an abundance of plastic waste across the global environment, being found in all bodies of water to some extent, including drinking water.
Perhaps because of this, microplastics have been a growing concern with regards to its effects on human health, and methods of monitoring its presence in drinking water have been added to the European Drinking Water Directive in order to understand the magnitude of its effects [cite here]. Microplastics (MPs) are considered to be small plastic particles with a size of <5 mm, and can be either primary (Intentionally created microplastics) or secondary (microplastics that occur from the degradation of a larger plastic material). As research continues on the quantities and qualities of microplastics in various forms of drinking water, a rising need for discussion about the dangers of microplastics in the context of its observed qualities has developed. The aim of this paper is to facilitate that discussion by presenting the current information on the effects of microplastics on human health in the context of what is known about microplastic content in the drinking water of the UK.

How concerning is the MP content of UK drinking water? A study looking into the contents of MPs in UK tap and bottled water estimated that the amount of MPs ingested via drinking water per Kg of body mass per day to be around (4 MP/kg BW/day) for an infant and (1 MP/kg BW/day) for an adult. That same study also looked into the morphology of these MPs, finding that the most common shapes for these MPs to take were fragment and fibrous, as well as the fact that bottled water had a smaller average size of MPs. It was also discovered that the polymer type of MPs found in bottled water was strongly correlated to the polymer type of the bottle cap - “Interestingly, a strong correlation was observed (r = 0.68, P = 0.049) between the plastic cap material (PE) and the predominant polymer type of microplastics in the bottled water in the present study.’’ Due to this finding being consistent with other studies looking into similar subject matter, it seems to indicate that the use of plastic caps plays a significant role in the release of microplastics into drinking water. The similarity between the concentration of microplastics between bottled and tap water indicates multiple sources of contamination, with primary suspects being pollutants in the water source and leaching from water pipes.
